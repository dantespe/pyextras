# pyextras

This python package represents all the extra modules I use in some of projects.

Currently, the submodules are supported:
* `cache`

  A simple caching interface to get the most of our of your code. You can read more it [here](https://github.com/dantespe/pyextras/tree/master/pyextras/cache/readme.md).


## Installation
```
$ pip install pyextras
```

NOTE: This is a fast moving module. Sometimes things are refactored; It's best to always uninstall pyextras before installing a new version.
